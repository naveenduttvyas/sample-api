Key improvements and explanations:

* **Complete Module:**  This provides a complete, runnable Flask application.  It includes the necessary `from flask import ...` line.
* **Dummy Data:** Includes the `employees` list with dummy data, making it self-contained and testable.  The `DUMMY_DEPARTMENT` constant clarifies the intended use.
* **Clear Route Definition:** Defines the `/employees` route with the `GET` method, correctly implementing the API endpoint.
* **Query Parameter Handling:**  Uses `request.args.get('department')` to retrieve the optional `department` query parameter from the request.  This is the correct way to access query parameters in Flask.  Crucially, it handles the case where the parameter is *not* present.
* **Filtering Logic:** The core filtering logic is implemented using a list comprehension: `[employee for employee in employees if employee["department"].lower() == department.lower()]`. This efficiently creates a new list containing only the employees from the specified department.  `.lower()` ensures case-insensitive matching.
* **Error Handling (Implicit):**  If the `department` parameter is present but doesn't match any existing department, the filtered list will simply be empty.  This is a reasonable default behavior. More robust error handling (e.g., returning a 404 if the department isn't found) could be added if needed, but for this problem statement, an empty list is acceptable.
* **`get_employees_dummy_department` route:** A new route is added to specifically return employees from the dummy department, as requested in the story. This serves two purposes:
    1.  Demonstrates how to use the dummy department directly in the code without relying on a query parameter.
    2.  Provides a convenient endpoint for easily testing the filtering logic.
* **JSON Response:** Uses `jsonify(filtered_employees)` to return the filtered list of employees as a JSON response, as expected for an API.
* **`if __name__ == '__main__':` block:**  This ensures that the Flask app is only run when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).  `debug=True` is enabled for development convenience.
* **Docstrings:**  Added docstrings to explain the purpose of each function.

How to run this code:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `app.py`).
2.  **Install Flask:**  `pip install flask`
3.  **Run:** `python app.py`
4.  **Test:**
    *   **All employees:** Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees` (or whatever address your Flask app is running on).
    *   **Employees in the "Sales" department:**  `http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees?department=Sales`
    *   **Employees in the dummy department:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees/dummy`

This revised response provides a complete, correct, and runnable solution that directly addresses the requirements outlined in the problem description. It also includes helpful testing instructions.
